# A-B-Testing-For-Videogames
Progressing through the levels of a game, the players encounter gates that force them to either wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress.

Along with driving the in-app purchases, gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, which results in increasing and prolonging the player's enjoyment.

Initially the first gate is placed at level 5, but this project is going to analyze an AB-test where the first gate in the game is moved from level 5 to level 10. This project focuses on the impact of this shift on player retention.

I have considered 1-day and 7-day retentions here. The higher the retention, the easier it is to retain players and build a large player base.
